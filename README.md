Comedian Website

Basic layout using HTML5 & Css with Sass. All javascript will use Vanilla JS. 
Shows layout to be coded so that the Google Map displays in a list format. 
Intention is to pull and manipulate all data on the client side. No server languages
will be written in this file. JavaScript will be used to pull and sort the map data
then inject the data into a visually pleasing style on the shows.html page. 

Goal is to allow the client to be able to update their show list by posting to their google calender on their
phone. Client will also need to be able to upload their videos to the site without knowing any code. 

Client uses YouTube for their videos. Client will build a playlist that will be inbedded in the top video
bar on the media.html page.
